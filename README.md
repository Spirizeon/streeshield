# Stree Shield: AI/ML-based Deepfake Detection
</div>

### üåê Real-time detection of face-swap deepfake videos and morphed images.

---

## Inspiration

With the increasing prevalence of deepfakes, digital media integrity is under threat. Deepfakes are often used for misinformation, fraud, and other malicious purposes. **Stree Shield** addresses this issue by offering a robust AI/ML solution to detect manipulated media effectively, ensuring digital authenticity and safeguarding public discourse.

---

## How is Stree Shield Different?

- **Dual Media Detection**: Supports **both images and videos** with distinct models for each, enhancing versatility and accuracy.
  
- **CNN and 3D CNN Models**: Utilizes **CNN for images** and **3D CNN for videos** to improve detection accuracy for different media types.

- **Real-time Results**: Provides **results in under 1 second for images** and less than 4 seconds for videos, ensuring rapid analysis.

- **User-friendly Design**: Features an intuitive interface with clear visual results and confidence percentages.

- **Multi-lingual Support**: Accessible to users in multiple languages, broadening its usability.

---

## Problem it Solves

- **Detecting Deepfakes**: Helps prevent the misuse of deepfake technology by accurately detecting manipulated media.
  
- **Media Integrity**: Ensures the authenticity of digital content, crucial for maintaining trust in digital communications.

---

## Approach

The **workflow** involves:

1. **Media Upload**: Users upload images or videos via a straightforward interface supporting formats like JPEG, PNG, MP4, and AVI.
  
2. **Media Type Detection**: The backend identifies the media type and triggers the appropriate processing model.

3. **Preprocessing and Data Augmentation**: Media files are resized, videos are frame-extracted, and both media types undergo augmentation to ensure reliable input.

4. **Model Inference**: 
   - **Images**: Classified using a CNN.
   - **Videos**: Analyzed using a 3D CNN for deepfake detection.

5. **Real-time Results**: Confidence percentages are calculated and displayed for both images and videos.
